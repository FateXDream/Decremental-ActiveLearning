    Source: UCI / Adult
    Preprocessing: The original Adult data set has 14 features, among which six are continuous and eight are categorical. In this data set, continuous features are discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Also, a categorical feature with m categories is converted to m binary features. Details on how each feature is converted can be found in the beginning of each file from this page. [JP98a]

2. gisette
    Source: NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge [IG05a]
    Preprocessing: The data set is also available at UCI. Because the labels of testing set are not available, here we use the validation set (gisette_valid.data and gisette_valid.labels) as the testing set. The training data (gisette_train) are feature-wisely scaled to [-1,1]. Then the testing data (gisette_valid) are scaled based on the same scaling factors for the training data. These two scaled data sets are used in [GXY11a]
